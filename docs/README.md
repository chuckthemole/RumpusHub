\# Documentation

This directory contains internal documentation, troubleshooting guides,
and development notes for working on this repository.

These docs are intended to capture practical knowledge, common issues,
and architectural decisions that may not be obvious from the code alone.

\## Structure

\- `troubleshooting/`  
  Common build, dependency, and runtime issues (e.g. Gradle, environment problems)

\- `development/`  
  Local development setup, workflows, and productivity tips

\- `frontend/`  
  React, UI components, and frontend architecture notes

\- `backend/`  
  Spring Boot, Gradle, and backend architecture patterns

\## Contributing

When adding new documentation:

\- Prefer short, focused files  
\- Use descriptive filenames  
\- Place docs in the most relevant subdirectory  
\- Write with future maintainers in mind

If a problem took time to debug, it probably belongs here.
